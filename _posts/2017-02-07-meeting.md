Hello everyone, we're back! It has been a long long long while but we have a new location, some new sponsors and some new people involved.

Here is a message from our presenter.

My name is Jesse Horne. I'm a developer at Pioneer. I was born and raised in Macon, Georgia. My first trip out of state was my first development job in a small town in Wyoming, called Afton. The load was heavy and I wasn't qualified... but we managed. Soon after, I accepted the position as a contractor at Pioneer, and have been here for around 6 months. In my spare time I'm an activist/organizer who focuses on working class and environmental issues.

I will be talking about Amazon's Chalice project, an open-source microframework designed for creating python API's that easily deploy to AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda. I will be talking about what it is, why we chose to use it over the other alternatives, and will build a small example application with it live.


The IMT Group will happily provide Pizza and Soda.
